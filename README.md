# Project Brainstorm
## Domain of Interest
Child education rates are a good indicator of flaws in the education system and could provide interesting conclusions when compared with other data (e.g. country GDP). Furthermore, child education is an integral factor in human development, making it very important to improve our education systems.

#### [Relationship between School Education and Economic Growth: SAARC Countries](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Relationship-between-School-Education-and-Economic-Hanif-Arshed/29d264979a41663601272681d622ffd83391fde1)
This project focuses on studying the relationship between the level of child education and the economic growth rate of SAARC countries. The results of dynamic panel data models reveal that tertiary education enrollment has the highest impact on growth compared to primary and secondary education enrollment.

#### [The relation of education quality and economic growth](https://github.com/Y750/Valdivia-Final-Project)
The project focuses on the relationship between education quality and economic growth, comparing models that account for and do not account for the measurement error of four different years. The data sources are based on data from different sources obtained from the World Development Indicators and the PISA web pages.

#### [The relation of poverty and education rates](https://github.com/joesdesk/poverty-and-education)
The project focuses on data visualization of the relationship between the education rates and poverty rates that can be quantified by the correlation and their dependence or lack thereof. This report shows that the simple assumption of a linear relationship is insufficient to describe the observations. However, a trend is that poverty rates are lower for counties whose populations have attained college degrees at higher rates, thus reinforcing the belief that education is a path out of poverty.

### Data-Driven Questions
#### How does wealth affect school completion for children?
* In what wealth quintile are students more likely to complete their education? What quintile are students least likely to complete their education?
* To find out, we will look at the wealth status (poorest, second, middle, fourth, and richest) for each student in the wealth quintile columns in the UNICEF “School Completion Rates” dataset. We will compare the percentage of students who completed their education (primary, lower, and secondary school) in each wealth quintile, and determine which wealth quintile had the highest percentage of completed education.

#### What region has the highest completion rate of education?
* What region has the greatest number of students who completed their education? What region has the least number of students who completed their education?
* Using the UNICEF “School Completion Rates” or “The State of the World’s Children 2019 Statistical” dataset, we will look at the percent of students who completed their education in primary, lower, and secondary school by region. We will then compare these percentages of students to each region.

#### In what regions do students have the highest literacy rates?
* Based on students’ education, which region has the highest literacy rate for 15-24 year-old students? Which region has the lowest literacy rate?
* We will look at the literacy rates for female and male students of the ages 15-24 years by region, using the UNICEF “The State of the World’s Children 2019 Statistical” dataset. We will average the percentages for both female and male students with proficient literacy and compare this new literacy rate by region and determine which region had the highest literacy rate.

### Finding Data
#### [Adjusted net attendance rate for children of primary school age](https://data.unicef.org/topic/education/primary-education/)
* The data was found on the UNICEF Website. UNICEF referenced the databases from the UNESCO Institute for Statistics and Education for All Global Monitoring Report 2013/14: _Teaching and Learning – Achieving Quality for All by UNESCO_ for their data.
* There are 423 rows and 7 columns, showing the country, indication of the completion of school, sex of the children and the completion rate of students for years 2016-2019.
* From the questions above, the second question can be answered from this data (What region has the highest completion rate of education?).

#### [Adjusted net attendance rate for adolescents of lower secondary school age](https://data.unicef.org/topic/education/secondary-education/)
* The data was found on the UNICEF Website. UNICEF referenced the databases from the UNESCO Institute for Statistics and Education for All Global Monitoring Report 2013/14: _Teaching and Learning – Achieving Quality for All by UNESCO_ for their data.
* There are 825 rows and 7 columns showing the country, indication of the completion of school, sex of the children and the completion rate of students for years 2016-2019.
* From the questions above, the second question can be answered from this data (What region has the highest completion rate of education?).

#### [Youth literacy rate for 15-24 years in different countries](https://data.unicef.org/topic/education/literacy/)
* The data was found on the UNICEF Website. UNICEF referenced the databases from the UNESCO Institute for Statistics and Education for All Global Monitoring Report 2013/14: _Teaching and Learning – Achieving Quality for All by UNESCO_ for their data.
* There are 312 rows and 6 columns showing the country, indicator of what the data represents, sex of the children and literacy for years 2016-2018.
* From the questions above, the third question can be answered by this dataset (In what regions do students have the highest literacy rates?)
